How to build:

1. Make sure yarn is installed. You can find installation instructions at https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/.
   This was tested with yarn version 1.22.19.

2. Enter the source code folder

    $ cd path/to/source

3. Install dependencies:

    $ yarn install

4. Run the build script

    $ yarn build

This puts all the extension content in dist/ folder
